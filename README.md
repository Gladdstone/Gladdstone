# Joe Farrell - Making Computers Go :computer:

Hi, I'm Joe (he/him) - software engineer and technical lead for a developing startup. Previously, I've worked developing SaaS applications and automated cloud environments. In my free time, I like playing card games and I'm a concert flautist. I'm always looking for a new project to occupy my time. Reach out if you're looking for someone to work with and you need someone who's defeated the mighty Node beast, tussled with the great Webpack hydra, and crossed the C# ocean. All to return to my one true love - Python - who awaits my return on the glistening shores of Ithaca.
