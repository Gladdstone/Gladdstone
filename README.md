Hi, I'm Joe (he/him) - software engineer specialising in SaaS applications and cloud automation. In my free time, I like playing card games and I'm a concert flautist. I'm an engineer of many interests and a variety of skills. I've defeated the mighty Node beast, tussled with the Webpack hydra, and crossed the great Dotnet ocean. All to return to my one true love - Python - who awaits my return on the glistening shores of Ithaca.
